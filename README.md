# MyPortfoliochallenge02
This is my Portfolio, the second challenge for class. This Portfolio was created to display my projects to future employers or to anyone. This website will be updated on a regular basis to add future projects or to improve code. On the website, html was used to outline my content and css was used to style the website. The first Project, "Project 1" has the first challenge, which is about code refactoring. CLICK on photo in project 1 to open the first challenge.
